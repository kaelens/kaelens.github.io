            I'm a figma/design enthusiast & oxford comma advocate. I'm interested in environmental
            sustainability, accessible design, human-computer interaction, and
            software development for underrepresented and marginalized
            communities. I'm currently fostering a growing love for gardening, 
            biking, and sudoku!

            As you may have noticed, this portfolio imitates some of my favourite parts
            about Figma. I figured since I have spent the majority of my summer
            reading design blogs and building anything I can imagine in Figma, I
            might as well build the things I love. I have started to notice the little and small details
            that make the experience so much better, which is something I have
            enjoyed about this project. It's currently a work in progress!
