This is my home page
<br>
I am not too sure what is going on, but I am mostly using it as a sandbox to learn more about coding
<br>
<br>
Also, I keep editing it and debugging it so I am so so so sorry for the 100s of contributions I have made in the past week. I can't make up my mind and I keep editing and changing because codepen just isnt cutting it for the image aspect smh
